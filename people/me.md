There are many Chris Smiths out there.

This one is a new asst. prof. at IU.
I use "Chris CR Smith" in my publications, and my google scholar profile is "[Chris CR Smith](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=ZHHGVn8AAAAJ)".
Before Indiana I did a brief postdoc in	the Cooperative	Institute for Environmental Sciences at	the CU Boulder.
Before that, I journeyed to the University of Oregon to work with Andy Kern.
I did my PhD at the CU Boulder with Sam Flaxman and Nolan Kane.
Earlier research experiences include lab technician work with Micheal Turelli at UC Davis and undergraduate research with Dan Bolnick at UT Austin.
