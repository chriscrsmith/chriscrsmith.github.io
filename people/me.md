There are many Chris Smiths out there.
This one just started at IU Bloomington.
I publish as "Chris CR Smith" and my google scholar profile is "[Chris CR Smith](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=ZHHGVn8AAAAJ)".
Before, I did a brief postdoc in	the Cooperative	Institute for Environmental Sciences at	CU Boulder.
Before that, I journeyed to the University of Oregon to work with Andy Kern.
I did my PhD at CU Boulder with Sam Flaxman and Nolan Kane.
