My research program is focused on developing methods that are broadly applicable in ecology and evolution, and that leverage cutting edge technologies from nucleotide sequencing, computer simulations, and machine learning. In addition to developing new methods, I am applying them to real data, contributing to community resources for simulating genetic data, and enjoying collaborating with others to apply my methods to their study systems.
