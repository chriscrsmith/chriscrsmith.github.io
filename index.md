I am building up a research lab exploring machine learning approaches for ecological genomics.
Genetic information are valuable for characterizing a population's spatial connectivity, migration with neighboring populations, phylogeographic and demographic history, and adaptation to the local environment. However, the complexity of genetic variation makes it challenging to model. For this task machine learning is a fascinating avenue because of its ability to find useful information in high-dimensionality data, and because new techniques are emerging rapidly. My interests lie in adapting these new approaches to the unique properties of genomic data, innovating deep learning architectures, and developing computational toolsets for applications in diverse species.
