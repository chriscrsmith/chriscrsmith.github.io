My current research is focused on methods-development for applications in ecology, evolution, and environmental science.
My research approach involves machine learning development, data science, and computation; and takes advantage of cutting edge data sources such as nucleotide sequencing and remote sensing.
In addition to developing new methods, I am applying them to answer questions about the natural world, contributing to community software resources, and enjoying collaborating with others to apply my methods to their study systems.
