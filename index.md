My current research is focused on computational methods-development for applications in ecology, evolutionary biology, and environmental science.
My research approach involves machine learning development, data science, and computation.
In addition to developing and applying new methods, I am contributing to community software resources, and enjoying collaborating with others to apply my methods to their study systems.
